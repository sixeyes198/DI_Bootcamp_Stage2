//Guess the answers

 
let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

console.log(a+b); //first expression
//prediction: 55 because a = 34 and b = 21... since we logging in a+b = 55
//actual: 55

a = 2;
console.log(a+b);
//prediction: 23 we changed a = 2 and then its basically like the first expression
//actual:23


/*  Third expression
 What is the value of c?
 prediction: undefined. c doesn't have a value. 
 actual: undefined
 */
console.log(c);


//4th expression
console.log(3 + 4 +'5');
//prediction : 75 , 3 & 4 are numbers and 5 is a string so 3+4 =7 and the log will be 75
//actual:
